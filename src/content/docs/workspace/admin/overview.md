The **Admin** area is the central management console in Dataflow, enabling administrators to configure, control, and oversee the platform’s operations, user access, and runtime settings.

---

## What Can Admins Do?

### 1. Manage Users

Admins can:

- Add, edit, or remove users from the platform  
- Assign users to specific teams and roles  
- Control individual user permissions for accessing Studio, Runtime, or Admin features

---

### 2. Manage Teams and Roles

Admins can:

- Create and manage **teams** to organise users based on departments, projects, or responsibilities  
- Define **roles** with specific access permissions to enforce security and efficient workflow management

---

### 3. Manage Studio Server Access

Admins can:

- Control which users or teams have access to the Studio environment  
- Configure available server specifications and compute resources for different user groups  
- Monitor server usage for cost and performance optimisation

---

### 4. Approve Python Environments

Admins oversee the lifecycle of Python environments created by users:

- **Review and approve** newly built environments before they are published for organisation-wide use  
- **Reject or revert** environments back to draft if configurations do not meet organisational standards  
- Ensure secure and compliant Python environment management

---

### 5. Manage Spark Servers

Admins can:

- Configure and manage Spark servers used across both **Studio** and **Runtime**  
- Control access, resources, and project allocations for Spark-based workloads  
- Monitor Spark server usage and performance to ensure optimal data processing capabilities

---

### 6. Runtime Settings

Admins can:

- Create and manage **projects within different runtimes** (e.g. Airflow, Spark, MLFlow) for various data workflows  
- Define project-level configurations and metadata  
- Manage global or project-specific **variables, secrets, and connections** to maintain security and flexibility across environments

---

## Summary

The Admin console empowers platform administrators to:

- Control **who** can access **what** within Dataflow  
- Manage and optimise **compute resources** for cost and performance efficiency  
- Ensure secure management of **environments, runtimes, variables, and secrets**  
- Oversee the organisation’s entire data infrastructure from a single interface
